# Day 1: Introductin, DOM, values& Data types and Operators

This README file summarizes the JavaScript basics .JavaScript as a high-level, client-side scripting language used for web development.

## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, we explored some concepts in JavaScript. Here are the key points covered:

- The DOM in JavaScript is a programming interface representing HTML and XML documents as a tree structure. 
- In JavaScript, values and data types play a crucial role in representing and manipulating information. JavaScript supports various data types, including: Primitive and Complex datatypes.
- operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports various types of operators.

## Coding Examples

```javascript
// Example 1: Introduction
let name = 'John';
let age = 30;
let res= name + age;
console.log('Name:', name);
console.log('Age:', age);
console.log(res);

```
